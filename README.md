# Personnel-Management-System
write some thing. One line each commit?

###Just for reference

###Foreword
 
When I took the position in Sep. 2014, there were three projects on our schedule: the Association's Web Portal, the personnel management system and the social network. The most important one is the first one: the web portal.

However, the project went rather slowly since I was busy with other tasks and had no time to spend on the project.

Finally I managed to spare some time and gathered several people to work on the project in 2015, and put it online in May. Though it was a bit naive at that time, we steadily improved it and the project was completed at length.

I have been longing for completing the second project during the 24th grade, but the Web team is not so reliable judging by previous experiences (well, just complaining). However, I don't want to abandon this project, and it's not just me that wanted to build such a system - previous leaders expect this as well. But they didn't get down to the project due to apparent difficulty.

I'm convinced that least people can do most things. As the schoolwork getting heavier and preparation for graduation drawing near, I want to find some partners to carry on the project with me, commit code in our spare time, and complete it before graduation.
